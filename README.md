This course project presents the development of a reinforcement learning agent for playing the Cartpole and the Lunar Landing Game using Reinforcement Learning(RL). The agent is trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which efficiently combines Neural Networks with Q-learning (A famous reinforcement learning strategy). 

Experimental results show that the agent learns to perform significantly well. It can also achieve scores comparable to the human-level expertise. We discuss model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and the reward system that enables the agentâ€™s learning process. Our results demonstrate the viability of Reinforcement Learning approaches in learning gaming strategies.
